# Basics

- Python is an interpreted language.
- Can be extended with new data types and functions via C or C++.
- It has a standard library that is described [here](https://github.com/peter-catalin/python-playground.git).

# Syntax

```python
# This is a comment in Python
# Python only has single-line comments
```

# Interactive interpreter mode

`>>>` - waiting for command
`...` - multi-line command
`_` - stores the value of the last operation. Should be read-only, do not assign to it as you will mask the value of the special variable with a local one.

# Arithmetic operators

The basic arithmetic operators are: +, -, *, /. Parentheses can be used for grouping.

`//` - floor division, discards the fractional part.
`%` - modulo, returns the remainder of the division.
`**` - exponentiation, raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.

# (WIP) Primitive data types

1. `int` - for integer numbers
2. `float` - for floating-point numbers. *division always returns a `float`*
3. `complex` - for complex numbers
4. `str` - strings, can be enclosed in single or double quotes.

# (WIP) Other types of numbers

1. `Decimal`
2. `Fraction`
